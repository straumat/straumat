### Hi, I'm Stéphane 👋

#### :technologist: About me
I’m a tech entrepreneur with a strong engineering background, building software products and companies for more than 20 years. I focus on pragmatic, long-term solutions at the intersection of software engineering, entrepreneurship, and investment.

I co-founded and actively run:
- [Scub](https://www.scub.net), a digital services company specializing in software engineering (Java, Cloud, Data/AI, Mobile), helping organizations design and build robust, scalable systems.
- [SPS Solutions](https://www.sps-solutions.fr), a software company providing a CRM and product distribution platform for the insurance industry.
- [Oak Invest](https://www.oak-invest.com), an investment holding through which I support and invest in technology-driven companies.

Through Oak Invest, I’m involved in several ventures, including:
- [50 partners](https://www.50partners.fr), a French startup accelerator and venture capital firm supporting early-stage startups in Tech, Impact, Health, and Web3.
- [Eldo](https://www.eldo.com/), a platform connecting homeowners with trusted construction professionals through verified reviews and digital tools.
- [Isia](https://www.isia.tech/), a secure and private AI assistant enabling companies to query and analyze their internal documents and data.
- [ThanksForLeads](https://thanksforleads.com), an application helping business leaders grow revenue by structuring and activating their professional network.
- [Agence 42](https://www.agence42.fr), (sold), a digital communication and branding agency.

I also lecture on topics such as software industrialization, cloud computing, and Bitcoin/blockchain, and I previously authored a technical book on the J2EE application server **JOnAS**.
